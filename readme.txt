The included files contain the code snippets for each of the chapters of the Pro Active Record: Databases with Ruby and Rails (Apress, 2007, ISBN: 1-59059-847-4) book.

Each file simply presents the code snippets in the order they appear in the full text of the book and are not meant to be executable as is. They are presented here primarily for the purpose of saving you some typing (so you can copy and paste) if you wish to use the code in your own applications and tests.

If you have any questions or comments about these samples or any of the information you find in the full text of the book, please feel free to email Kevin Marshall directly at info@falicon.com.
